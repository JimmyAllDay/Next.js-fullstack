# Fullstack Authentication Example with Next.js and NextAuth.js

A walkthrough project for learning full stack Next.js with Prisma, PostGresql and Typescript, from the tutorial located at: https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres

I've gitignored an essential .env file to protect private info but the app will work if a database is instantiated using the method described here: https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1

You will also need to add the .env in the root of your local directory, then add to the file a variable as follows:

DATABASE_URL="<url>"

You will also need to run npm install in the root directory.
